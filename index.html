            <p>Even with careful preparation, users may encounter various login problems. This section addresses the most common issues and provides practical solutions to resolve them quickly.</p>

            <h3 style="color: #e74c3c; margin: 25px 0 15px 0;">Forgotten Password Recovery</h3>

            <p>If you've forgotten your VIPRE account password, the recovery process is straightforward but requires access to your registered email address. Click the "Forgot Password" link on the login page, enter your email address, and follow the instructions sent to your inbox.

            <p>New accounts often require email verification before full access is granted. Check your email inbox, including spam and junk folders, for verification messages from VIPRE. Click the verification link within the specified timeframe to activate your account fully.</p>

            <h3 style="color: #e74c3c; margin: 25px 0 15px 0;">Browser Compatibility Issues</h3>

            <p>Some browsers may have compatibility issues with the VIPRE login portal. Try clearing your browser cache and cookies, disabling browser extensions temporarily, or switching to a different browser if problems persist.</p>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Keep your VIPRE account credentials secure by using a reputable password manager. This ensures you always have access to your login information while maintaining strong security practices.
